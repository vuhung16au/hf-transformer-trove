## 1. Full Attention Fundamentals

### What is Full Attention?

**Full attention** refers to the standard attention mechanism where each position in a sequence can attend to every other position, creating a complete attention matrix. This is the attention mechanism used in the original Transformer architecture and most transformer models.

> **Key Characteristic**: In full attention, the attention matrix is square with dimensions [sequence_length × sequence_length], allowing unrestricted information flow between all positions.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
import numpy as np

def visualize_full_attention_concept():
    """
    Demonstrate the concept of full attention with a visual representation.
    """
    print("=== Full Attention Concept ===")
    
    # Example sentence: "The cat sits on mat"
    sequence = ["The", "cat", "sits", "on", "mat"]
    seq_len = len(sequence)
    
    # Create a sample attention matrix (normally computed from Q, K, V)
    # Each row shows what each word attends to
    torch.manual_seed(42)
    attention_matrix = torch.softmax(torch.randn(seq_len, seq_len), dim=-1)
    
    print(f"Sequence: {sequence}")
    print(f"Sequence length: {seq_len}")
    print(f"Attention matrix shape: {attention_matrix.shape}")
    print(f"Total attention computations: {seq_len * seq_len} = {seq_len}²")
    print()
    
    # Visualize attention matrix
    print("Attention Matrix (rows=from, columns=to):")
    print(f"{'':>8}", end="")
    for word in sequence:
        print(f"{word:>8}", end="")
    print()
    
    for i, from_word in enumerate(sequence):
        print(f"{from_word:>8}", end="")
        for j in range(seq_len):
            print(f"{attention_matrix[i, j]:.3f}".rjust(8), end="")
        print()
    
    return attention_matrix

# Demonstrate full attention
attention_matrix = visualize_full_attention_concept()
```

### Characteristics of Full Attention

1. **Unrestricted Access**: Every token can attend to every other token
2. **Parallel Computation**: All attention weights computed simultaneously
3. **Context-Aware**: Rich contextual understanding through global attention
4. **Quadratic Complexity**: Computational cost scales as O(n²) with sequence length

## 2. Mathematical Foundation of Full Attention

### The Scaled Dot-Product Attention Formula

The core of full attention is the scaled dot-product attention mechanism:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Where:
- $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$ is the query matrix
- $K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$ is the key matrix  
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_v}$ is the value matrix
- $n$ is the sequence length (creating an $n \times n$ attention matrix)
- $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors

```python
def full_attention_implementation(query, key, value, mask=None):
    """
    Implement full attention mechanism step by step.
    
    Args:
        query: Query tensor [batch, seq_len, d_model]

    """
    print("=== Full Attention Implementation ===")
    
    batch_size, seq_len, d_model = query.shape
    d_k = d_model  # Assuming same dimension for simplicity
    
    print(f"Input dimensions:")
    print(f"  Batch size: {batch_size}")
    print(f"  Sequence length: {seq_len}")
    print(f"  Model dimension: {d_model}")

    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))
    print(f"Raw attention scores shape: {scores.shape}")
    
    # Step 2: Scale by sqrt(d_k) for numerical stability
    scores = scores / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(d_k, dtype=torch.float32))
    print(f"Scaled scores range: [{scores.min():.3f}, {scores.max():.3f}]")
    
    # Step 3: Apply mask if provided (e.g., for causal attention or padding)
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
        print("Applied attention mask")

## 3. Computational Complexity and Memory Requirements

### Understanding O(n²) Complexity

Full attention has **quadratic computational complexity** in the sequence length, which becomes a significant bottleneck for long sequences:

```python
def analyze_attention_complexity():
    """
    Analyze the computational complexity of full attention.
    """
    print("=== Full Attention Complexity Analysis ===")
    
    sequence_lengths = [128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096]
    
    print(f"{'Seq Length':>10} {'Attention Size':>15} {'Memory (MB)':>12} {'Relative Cost':>15}")
    print("-" * 60)
    
    base_cost = sequence_lengths[0] ** 2
    
    for seq_len in sequence_lengths:
        attention_size = seq_len ** 2
        memory_mb = attention_size * 4 / (1024 ** 2)  # 4 bytes per float32
        relative_cost = attention_size / base_cost
        
        print(f"{seq_len:>10} {attention_size:>15,} {memory_mb:>12.1f} {relative_cost:>15.1f}x")
    
    print(f"\nKey Insights:")
    print(f"- Memory grows quadratically: O(n²)")
    print(f"- Doubling sequence length = 4x memory")
    print(f"- Long sequences (>2048) require significant GPU memory")
    print(f"- This is why specialized attention mechanisms exist")

analyze_attention_complexity()
```

### Memory and Performance Implications

> ⚠️ **Performance Warning**: Standard attention mechanisms have O(n²) memory complexity. For a sequence of length 4000, the attention matrix alone requires ~64MB, and with multiple layers and heads, memory usage can quickly exceed GPU capacity.

## 4. Why Attention Mechanisms Signify in NLP

### The NLP Revolution

Attention mechanisms transformed natural language processing by solving fundamental limitations of previous approaches:

#### 1. **Long-Range Dependencies**
```python
def demonstrate_long_range_dependencies():
    """
    Show how attention handles long-range dependencies in text.
    """
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
    import torch
    
    def get_device() -> torch.device:
        """Get the best available device."""
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            return torch.device("cuda")
        elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
            return torch.device("mps")
        else:
            return torch.device("cpu")
    
    print("=== Long-Range Dependencies in NLP ===")
    
    # Example demonstrating long-range dependencies
    text = """
    The movie that was released last year and won several awards including 
    the Oscar for best picture, which was directed by Christopher Nolan and 
    starred Leonardo DiCaprio in a complex narrative about dreams within dreams, 
    was absolutely brilliant.
    """
    
    print("Example text with long-range dependencies:")
    print(text.strip())
    print()
    
    # Key observation: "was" at the end refers to "movie" at the beginning
    print("Key Challenge:")
    print("- The verb 'was' at the end must agree with 'movie' at the beginning")
    print("- Traditional RNNs struggle with such long-range dependencies") 
    print("- Attention allows direct connection between distant positions")
    print()
    
    print("How attention solves this:")
    print("1. Direct connections: Any position can attend to any other position")
    print("2. Parallel processing: No sequential bottleneck")
    print("3. Context preservation: Information doesn't degrade over distance")

```

#### 2. **Contextual Understanding**
```python
def demonstrate_contextual_understanding():
    """
    Show how attention provides contextual understanding.
    """
    print("=== Contextual Understanding with Attention ===")
    
    # Word sense disambiguation examples
    examples = [
        {
            "sentence": "The bank was closed due to the holiday.",
            "word": "bank",
            "context": "financial institution"
        },
        {
            "sentence": "We sat by the river bank and watched the sunset.",
            "word": "bank", 
            "context": "edge of river"
        },
        {
            "sentence": "I need to bank this check before 3 PM.",
            "word": "bank",
            "context": "deposit money"

    print("How attention helps:")
    print("- Attends to surrounding words to disambiguate meaning")
    print("- 'holiday' indicates financial bank, 'river' indicates riverbank")
    print("- Multiple attention heads can capture different aspects of context")
    print("- Enables nuanced understanding impossible with simple word embeddings")

```

#### 3. **Parallel Processing**
Unlike sequential models (RNNs/LSTMs), attention enables parallel computation:

```python
def compare_sequential_vs_parallel():
    """
    Compare sequential processing vs parallel attention.
    """
    print("=== Sequential vs Parallel Processing ===")
    
    sequence_length = 1000
    
    print("Sequential Processing (RNN/LSTM):")
    print(f"- Process tokens one by one: t₁ → t₂ → t₃ → ... → t_{sequence_length}")
    print(f"- Total steps: {sequence_length}")
    print(f"- Cannot parallelize across sequence")
    print(f"- Information bottleneck at each step")
    print()
    
    print("Parallel Processing (Attention):")
    print(f"- Process all tokens simultaneously")
    print(f"- Total steps: 1 (matrix operations)")
    print(f"- Fully parallelizable on GPUs")
    print(f"- Direct access to all positions")
    print()
    
    print("Performance Impact:")
    print(f"- Training speed: ~10-100x faster")
    print(f"- GPU utilization: Much higher")
    print(f"- Scalability: Better for long sequences (within memory limits)")

    """
    print("=== Attention Benefits for Hate Speech Classification ===")

    print("   - Attention helps model understand contextual nuances")
    print()
    
    print("2. **Subtle Pattern Recognition**")
    print("   - Hate speech often uses coded language or euphemisms")
    print("   - Attention can identify patterns across non-adjacent words")
    print()
    
    print("3. **Negation and Modifier Handling**")
    print("   - 'Not racist' vs 'racist' - attention captures negation")
    print("   - Modifiers like 'somewhat', 'extremely' affect severity")
    print()
    
    print("4. **Multi-word Expression Understanding**")
    print("   - Hate speech often involves multi-word expressions")
    print("   - Attention links related words across the sentence")

### Flash Attention: Memory-Efficient Attention

**Flash Attention** is a groundbreaking technique that optimizes the attention mechanism in transformer models by addressing memory bandwidth bottlenecks. As discussed earlier in the complexity analysis, the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity and memory usage, making it inefficient for long sequences.

> **Key Innovation**: Flash Attention doesn't change the mathematical computation of attention - it optimizes *how* the computation is performed in memory to dramatically reduce memory bandwidth requirements.

#### The Memory Bandwidth Problem

Traditional attention implementations suffer from a critical bottleneck:

```python
def traditional_attention_memory_analysis():
    """
    Analyze memory access patterns in traditional attention implementation.
    """
    print("=== Traditional Attention Memory Access Pattern ===")

    print("Traditional Attention Steps:")
    print(f"1. Compute QK^T: Load Q[{seq_len}, {d_model}] and K[{seq_len}, {d_model}] from HBM")
    print(f"   → Creates attention matrix [{seq_len}, {seq_len}] in HBM")
    print(f"   → Memory: {seq_len * seq_len * 4 / (1024**2):.1f} MB for attention scores")
    
    print(f"2. Apply softmax: Load attention matrix from HBM to SRAM")
    print(f"   → Process softmax, write back to HBM")
    
    print(f"3. Multiply by V: Load attention matrix and V[{seq_len}, {d_model}] from HBM")
    print(f"   → Compute final output")
    
    print(f"\nMemory Access Analysis:")
    print(f"- Multiple HBM ↔ SRAM transfers for the same data")
    print(f"- Attention matrix stored in slow HBM memory")
    print(f"- GPU cores often idle waiting for memory transfers")
    print(f"- Memory bandwidth becomes the bottleneck, not computation")
