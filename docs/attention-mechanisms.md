## 1. Full Attention Fundamentals

### What is Full Attention?

**Full attention** refers to the standard attention mechanism where each position in a sequence can attend to every other position, creating a complete attention matrix. This is the attention mechanism used in the original Transformer architecture and most transformer models.

> **Key Characteristic**: In full attention, the attention matrix is square with dimensions [sequence_length × sequence_length], allowing unrestricted information flow between all positions.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
import numpy as np

def visualize_full_attention_concept():
    """
    Demonstrate the concept of full attention with a visual representation.
    """
    print("=== Full Attention Concept ===")
    
    # Example sentence: "The cat sits on mat"
    sequence = ["The", "cat", "sits", "on", "mat"]
    seq_len = len(sequence)
    
    # Create a sample attention matrix (normally computed from Q, K, V)
    # Each row shows what each word attends to
    torch.manual_seed(42)
    attention_matrix = torch.softmax(torch.randn(seq_len, seq_len), dim=-1)
    
    print(f"Sequence: {sequence}")
    print(f"Sequence length: {seq_len}")
    print(f"Attention matrix shape: {attention_matrix.shape}")
    print(f"Total attention computations: {seq_len * seq_len} = {seq_len}²")
    print()
    
    # Visualize attention matrix
    print("Attention Matrix (rows=from, columns=to):")
    print(f"{'':>8}", end="")
    for word in sequence:
        print(f"{word:>8}", end="")
    print()
    
    for i, from_word in enumerate(sequence):
        print(f"{from_word:>8}", end="")
        for j in range(seq_len):
            print(f"{attention_matrix[i, j]:.3f}".rjust(8), end="")
        print()
    
    return attention_matrix

# Demonstrate full attention
attention_matrix = visualize_full_attention_concept()
```

### Characteristics of Full Attention

1. **Unrestricted Access**: Every token can attend to every other token
2. **Parallel Computation**: All attention weights computed simultaneously
3. **Context-Aware**: Rich contextual understanding through global attention
4. **Quadratic Complexity**: Computational cost scales as O(n²) with sequence length

## 2. Mathematical Foundation of Full Attention

### The Scaled Dot-Product Attention Formula

The core of full attention is the scaled dot-product attention mechanism:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Where:
- $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$ is the query matrix
- $K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$ is the key matrix  
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_v}$ is the value matrix
- $n$ is the sequence length (creating an $n \times n$ attention matrix)
- $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors

```python
def full_attention_implementation(query, key, value, mask=None):
    """
    Implement full attention mechanism step by step.
    
    Args:
        query: Query tensor [batch, seq_len, d_model]

    """
    print("=== Full Attention Implementation ===")
    
    batch_size, seq_len, d_model = query.shape
    d_k = d_model  # Assuming same dimension for simplicity
    
    print(f"Input dimensions:")
    print(f"  Batch size: {batch_size}")
    print(f"  Sequence length: {seq_len}")
    print(f"  Model dimension: {d_model}")

    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))
    print(f"Raw attention scores shape: {scores.shape}")

    scores = scores / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(d_k, dtype=torch.float32))
    print(f"Scaled scores range: [{scores.min():.3f}, {scores.max():.3f}]")
    
    # Step 3: Apply mask if provided (e.g., for causal attention or padding)
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
        print("Applied attention mask")

## 3. Computational Complexity and Memory Requirements

### Understanding O(n²) Complexity

Full attention has **quadratic computational complexity** in the sequence length, which becomes a significant bottleneck for long sequences:

```python
def analyze_attention_complexity():
    """
    Analyze the computational complexity of full attention.
    """
    print("=== Full Attention Complexity Analysis ===")
    
    sequence_lengths = [128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096]
    
    print(f"{'Seq Length':>10} {'Attention Size':>15} {'Memory (MB)':>12} {'Relative Cost':>15}")
    print("-" * 60)
    
    base_cost = sequence_lengths[0] ** 2
    
    for seq_len in sequence_lengths:
        attention_size = seq_len ** 2
        memory_mb = attention_size * 4 / (1024 ** 2)  # 4 bytes per float32
        relative_cost = attention_size / base_cost
        
        print(f"{seq_len:>10} {attention_size:>15,} {memory_mb:>12.1f} {relative_cost:>15.1f}x")
    
    print(f"\nKey Insights:")
    print(f"- Memory grows quadratically: O(n²)")
    print(f"- Doubling sequence length = 4x memory")
    print(f"- Long sequences (>2048) require significant GPU memory")
    print(f"- This is why specialized attention mechanisms exist")

analyze_attention_complexity()
```

### Memory and Performance Implications

> ⚠️ **Performance Warning**: Standard attention mechanisms have O(n²) memory complexity. For a sequence of length 4000, the attention matrix alone requires ~64MB, and with multiple layers and heads, memory usage can quickly exceed GPU capacity.

## 4. Why Attention Mechanisms Signify in NLP

### The NLP Revolution

Attention mechanisms transformed natural language processing by solving fundamental limitations of previous approaches:

#### 1. **Long-Range Dependencies**
```python
def demonstrate_long_range_dependencies():
    """
    Show how attention handles long-range dependencies in text.
    """
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
    import torch
    
    def get_device() -> torch.device:
        """Get the best available device."""
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            return torch.device("cuda")
        elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
            return torch.device("mps")
        else:
            return torch.device("cpu")
    
    print("=== Long-Range Dependencies in NLP ===")
    
    # Example demonstrating long-range dependencies
    text = """
    The movie that was released last year and won several awards including 
    the Oscar for best picture, which was directed by Christopher Nolan and 
    starred Leonardo DiCaprio in a complex narrative about dreams within dreams, 
    was absolutely brilliant.
    """
    
    print("Example text with long-range dependencies:")
    print(text.strip())
    print()
    
    # Key observation: "was" at the end refers to "movie" at the beginning
    print("Key Challenge:")
    print("- The verb 'was' at the end must agree with 'movie' at the beginning")
    print("- Traditional RNNs struggle with such long-range dependencies") 
    print("- Attention allows direct connection between distant positions")
    print()
    
    print("How attention solves this:")
    print("1. Direct connections: Any position can attend to any other position")
    print("2. Parallel processing: No sequential bottleneck")
    print("3. Context preservation: Information doesn't degrade over distance")

```

#### 2. **Contextual Understanding**
```python
def demonstrate_contextual_understanding():
    """
    Show how attention provides contextual understanding.
    """
    print("=== Contextual Understanding with Attention ===")
    
    # Word sense disambiguation examples
    examples = [
        {
            "sentence": "The bank was closed due to the holiday.",
            "word": "bank",
            "context": "financial institution"
        },
        {
            "sentence": "We sat by the river bank and watched the sunset.",
            "word": "bank", 
            "context": "edge of river"
        },
        {
            "sentence": "I need to bank this check before 3 PM.",
            "word": "bank",
            "context": "deposit money"

    print("How attention helps:")
    print("- Attends to surrounding words to disambiguate meaning")
    print("- 'holiday' indicates financial bank, 'river' indicates riverbank")
    print("- Multiple attention heads can capture different aspects of context")
    print("- Enables nuanced understanding impossible with simple word embeddings")

```

#### 3. **Parallel Processing**
Unlike sequential models (RNNs/LSTMs), attention enables parallel computation:

```python
def compare_sequential_vs_parallel():
    """
    Compare sequential processing vs parallel attention.
    """
    print("=== Sequential vs Parallel Processing ===")
    
    sequence_length = 1000
    
    print("Sequential Processing (RNN/LSTM):")
    print(f"- Process tokens one by one: t₁ → t₂ → t₃ → ... → t_{sequence_length}")
    print(f"- Total steps: {sequence_length}")
    print(f"- Cannot parallelize across sequence")
    print(f"- Information bottleneck at each step")
    print()
    
    print("Parallel Processing (Attention):")
    print(f"- Process all tokens simultaneously")
    print(f"- Total steps: 1 (matrix operations)")
    print(f"- Fully parallelizable on GPUs")
    print(f"- Direct access to all positions")
    print()
    
    print("Performance Impact:")
    print(f"- Training speed: ~10-100x faster")
    print(f"- GPU utilization: Much higher")
    print(f"- Scalability: Better for long sequences (within memory limits)")

    print()
    
    print("2. **Subtle Pattern Recognition**")
    print("   - Hate speech often uses coded language or euphemisms")
    print("   - Attention can identify patterns across non-adjacent words")
    print()
    
    print("3. **Negation and Modifier Handling**")
    print("   - 'Not racist' vs 'racist' - attention captures negation")
    print("   - Modifiers like 'somewhat', 'extremely' affect severity")
    print()
    
    print("4. **Multi-word Expression Understanding**")
    print("   - Hate speech often involves multi-word expressions")
    print("   - Attention links related words across the sentence")
