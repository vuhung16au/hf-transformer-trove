# GitHub Copilot Instructions for HF Transformer Trove

## Project Overview
This repository is an educational resource for learning the Hugging Face ecosystem and serves as a study note for those who want to learn NLP. All code should be:
- Educational and well-documented with clear explanations and comments
- Follow best practices for machine learning workflows
- Use modern Hugging Face APIs and patterns
- Make it easy to understand and educational
- Assume readers are familiar with machine learning, PyTorch, and NLP basics

### Learning Resources References

## Modular Instructions Structure

This instruction file has been refactored into focused, modular components. For detailed guidelines, refer to the appropriate instruction file:

### 🐍 Code Style & Standards
**File**: `.github/instructions/code-style.instructions.md`
- Python code style guidelines and best practices
- Object-oriented programming patterns
- Error handling and educational commenting standards
- Code quality and modularity requirements

### ⚙️ Technical Preferences
**File**: `.github/instructions/technical-preferences.instructions.md`
- Framework and technology stack preferences (PyTorch, HuggingFace ecosystem)
- Device awareness implementation (CUDA/MPS/CPU)
- Credential management patterns for local and cloud environments
- Dependency management and performance optimization standards

### 📋 Templates & Snippets
**File**: `.github/instructions/templates.instructions.md`
- Reusable code templates and patterns
- Notebook header and footer templates
- Mathematical notation and diagram templates
- Error handling and evaluation templates

### 📓 Jupyter Notebook Guidelines
**File**: `.github/instructions/examples/notebooks.instructions.md`
- Notebook structure and educational content standards
- Platform compatibility (local, Colab, Kaggle)
- Learning progression and complexity guidelines
- Integration patterns with repository structure

### 📖 Documentation Guidelines  
**File**: `.github/instructions/docs/documentation.instructions.md`
- Documentation writing standards and structure
- Technical content requirements
- Cross-referencing and navigation patterns
- Visual elements and accessibility guidelines

## Core Principles Summary

### Educational First
- Prioritize learning value over code brevity
- Use progressive complexity (basic → advanced)
- Show multiple approaches and before/after comparisons
- Include performance and memory considerations

### Modern Best Practices
- Use latest Hugging Face APIs and patterns
- Prefer `Auto*` classes for flexibility
- Show both high-level (pipeline) and low-level implementations
- Include comprehensive error handling

### Consistency & Quality
- Follow modular instruction guidelines for your specific file type
- Maintain cross-repository references and learning paths
- Ensure all examples are runnable and well-documented
- Test compatibility across platforms (local, Colab, Kaggle)
