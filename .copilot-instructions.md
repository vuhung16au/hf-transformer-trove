# GitHub Copilot Instructions for HF Transformer Trove

## Project Overview
This repository is an educational resource for learning the Hugging Face ecosystem and serves as a study note for those who want to learn NLP. All code should be:
- Educational and well-documented with clear explanations and comments
- Follow best practices for machine learning workflows
- Use modern Hugging Face APIs and patterns
- Make it easy to understand and educational
- Assume readers are familiar with machine learning, PyTorch, and NLP basics

### Repository Focus Areas
This repository specifically focuses on:
- **Implementation with HF (Hugging Face)**: Primary framework and ecosystem for all implementations
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Core domain focus with comprehensive coverage of NLP tasks
- **Hate Speech Detection (Preferred)**: Emphasized application area for practical examples and use cases

### Preferred Models and Datasets for Examples
When creating examples, prioritize these hate speech detection models and datasets:

#### Models (in order of preference):
1. **cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-hate-latest** - Primary choice for social media content
2. **facebook/roberta-hate-speech-dynabench-r4-target** - Robust general hate speech detection
3. **GroNLP/hateBERT** - Specialized architecture for educational examples
4. **Hate-speech-CNERG/dehatebert-mono-english** - DeBERTa-based approach
5. **cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-offensive** - Alternative for offensive language

#### Datasets (in order of preference):
1. **tdavidson/hate_speech_offensive** - Standard benchmark dataset
2. **Hate-speech-CNERG/hatexplain** - Includes explanations for interpretability
3. **TrustAIRLab/HateBenchSet** - Comprehensive benchmark suite
4. **iamollas/ethos** - For ethical AI considerations

## Core Principles Summary

### Educational First
- Prioritize learning value over code brevity
- Use progressive complexity (basic ‚Üí advanced)
- Show multiple approaches and before/after comparisons
- Include performance and memory considerations

### Modern Best Practices
- Use latest Hugging Face APIs and patterns
- Prefer `Auto*` classes for flexibility
- Show both high-level (pipeline) and low-level implementations
- Include comprehensive error handling

### Consistency & Quality
- Follow modular instruction guidelines for your specific file type
- Maintain cross-repository references and learning paths
- Ensure all examples are runnable and well-documented
- Test compatibility across platforms (local, Colab, Kaggle)
