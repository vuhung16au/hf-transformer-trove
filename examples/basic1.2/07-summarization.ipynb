    "\n",
    "**Extractive Summarization:**\n",
    "- Selects and combines existing sentences from the original text\n",
    "- Maintains original phrasing and vocabulary\n",
    "- Example: Highlighting key sentences in a document\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstractive Summarization:**\n",
    "- Generates new text that captures the essence of the original\n",
    "- Can rephrase and restructure information\n",
    "- More human-like but computationally complex\n",
