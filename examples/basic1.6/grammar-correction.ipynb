    "# Grammar Correction with T5 Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "- How to use T5 models for grammar correction tasks\n",
    "- The text-to-text approach for fixing grammatical errors\n",
    "- Working with grammar correction across multiple languages (English, Vietnamese, Japanese)\n",
    "- Best practices for grammar correction with transformers\n",
    "- How to evaluate grammar correction quality\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python and PyTorch\n",
    "- Knowledge of NLP fundamentals (refer to [NLP Learning Journey](https://github.com/vuhung16au/nlp-learning-journey))\n",
    "- Understanding of encoder-decoder architectures (refer to [docs/encoder-decoder.md](../../docs/encoder-decoder.md))\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What We'll Cover\n",
    "1. **Introduction**: Grammar correction with T5\n",
    "2. **Basic Setup**: Loading models and tokenizers\n",
    "3. **English Grammar Correction**: Common error patterns\n",
    "4. **Multilingual Correction**: Vietnamese and Japanese examples\n",
    "5. **Advanced Techniques**: Fine-tuning and optimization\n",
    "6. **Evaluation**: Quality assessment methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Grammar Correction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Grammar correction is a **sequence-to-sequence task** where we transform grammatically incorrect text into grammatically correct text. The T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model excels at this task by treating it as a text generation problem with the prefix **\"grammar: \"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why T5 for Grammar Correction?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unified Framework**: T5 treats all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems\n",
    "- **Context Understanding**: Encoder-decoder architecture captures full sentence context\n",
    "- **Flexible Output**: Can handle various types of corrections simultaneously\n",
    "- **Multilingual Support**: Works across different languages with appropriate models"
