    "## Why Reasoning Matters for Hate Speech Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional hate speech classifiers** often struggle with:\n",
    "- **Implicit hate speech**: Sarcasm, coded language, cultural references\n",
    "- **Context dependency**: Same words can be hateful or harmless based on context\n",
    "- **Evolving language**: New slang, euphemisms, and dog whistles\n",
    "- **False positives**: Misclassifying legitimate discussions about hate speech\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning-based approaches** address these by:\n",
    "- 🧠 **Analyzing intent**: Understanding the purpose behind the message\n",
    "- 🎯 **Identifying targets**: Recognizing who or what is being targeted\n",
    "- 📝 **Explaining decisions**: Providing transparent justification\n",
    "- 📋 **Policy alignment**: Matching decisions to specific platform policies\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematics of Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional classification: $P(\\text{hate}|\\text{text}) = \\text{classifier}(\\text{text})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning-based classification:\n",
    "$$P(\\text{hate}|\\text{text}, \\text{reasoning}) = \\text{LLM}(\\text{text} + \\text{reasoning\\_prompt})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the reasoning prompt guides the model through:\n",
    "1. **Target identification**: Who/what is being discussed?\n",
    "2. **Intent analysis**: What is the speaker trying to achieve?\n",
    "3. **Policy matching**: Does this violate specific guidelines?\n",
    "4. **Final classification**: Based on the reasoning chain"
