    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "- How to authenticate with Hugging Face Hub\n",
    "- How to use the `push_to_hub` API for models and tokenizers\n",
    "- How to push datasets to the Hub\n",
    "- Best practices for model sharing and versioning\n",
    "- How to handle private vs public repositories\n",
    "- Troubleshooting common push_to_hub issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",

    "- Familiarity with Python and PyTorch\n",
    "- Knowledge of Hugging Face transformers library\n",
    "- A Hugging Face account (create one at https://huggingface.co/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What We'll Cover\n",
    "1. **Authentication Setup**: Secure login and token management\n",
    "2. **Model Creation**: Fine-tune a hate speech detection model\n",
    "3. **Push Models**: Upload models and tokenizers to the Hub\n",
    "4. **Push Datasets**: Share datasets with the community\n",
    "5. **Model Cards**: Create comprehensive documentation\n",
    "6. **Best Practices**: Security, versioning, and collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Educational Focus**: This notebook demonstrates pushing a hate speech detection model to showcase practical applications in content moderation and social media analysis.\n",
    "\n",

    "This is a demonstration model for hate speech detection, based on `{model_name}`.\n",
    "It's designed to classify text into three categories:\n",
    "- **Hate Speech** (0): Content that attacks or discriminates against individuals or groups\n",
    "- **Offensive Language** (1): Content that is rude or inappropriate but not necessarily hateful\n",
    "- **Neither** (2): Normal, acceptable content\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Use**: Educational demonstration of the push_to_hub API\n",
    "**Secondary Use**: Content moderation research and development\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is based on the pre-trained model `{model_name}` for educational purposes.\n",

    "- Davidson et al. Hate Speech Dataset\n",
    "- HatEval Dataset\n",

    "## Limitations and Bias\n",

    "⚠️ **Important Limitations**:\n",
    "1. This is a demonstration model for educational purposes\n",
    "2. Not suitable for production use without proper evaluation\n",
    "3. May contain biases present in the original training data\n",
    "4. Performance may vary significantly on real-world data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always review model outputs for bias and fairness\n",
    "- Consider the impact of automated content moderation\n",
    "- Ensure human oversight in moderation decisions\n",
    "- Be transparent about model limitations\n",
