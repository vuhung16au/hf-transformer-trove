    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "- How translation works as a sequence-to-sequence task\n",
    "- How BART and T5 models handle translation\n",
    "- Using encoder-decoder architectures for translation\n",
    "- Basic translation implementation with Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python and PyTorch\n",
    "- Knowledge of NLP fundamentals (refer to [NLP Learning Journey](https://github.com/vuhung16au/nlp-learning-journey))\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What We'll Cover\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Environment and device detection\n",
    "2. **Translation Basics**: Understanding sequence-to-sequence tasks\n",
    "3. **BART for Translation**: How BART adapts to translation\n",
    "4. **T5 for Translation**: Using T5's text-to-text framework\n",
    "5. **Practical Examples**: Simple translation demonstrations\n",
    "6. **Summary**: Key takeaways and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Translation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation involves converting text from one language to another while preserving its meaning. Translation is a sequence-to-sequence task, which means you can use encoder-decoder models like **BART** or **T5** to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How BART Works for Translation\n",
    "BART adapts to translation by adding a separate randomly initialized encoder to map a source language to an input that can be decoded into the target language. This new encoder's embeddings are passed to the pretrained encoder instead of the original word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How T5 Works for Translation\n",
    "T5 treats translation as a text-to-text task, where the input is prefixed with \"translate [source] to [target]:\" followed by the source text."
